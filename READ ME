Stylized Caustics Blending Example
==================================

The accompanying code contains a very basic Matlab implementation of the progressive point matching procedure from the paper:

"Stylized Caustics: Progressive Rendering of Animated Caustics", Tobias Günther, Kai Rohmer, Christian Roessl, Thorsten Grosch and Holger Theisel, Computer Graphics Forum (Proc. Eurographics), 2016.


The Matlab Scripts 'test_blending.m' and 'test_blending_progressive.m' both blend between two images. The latter uses a progressive version, which reduces noise.
See the headers of the files for a description of the test cases.

The code was tested on Matlab 2015 and requires a C++ compiler to compile the MEX files.
